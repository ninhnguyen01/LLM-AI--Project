<h2>What is a large language model (LLM)?</h2>

<p>A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks. LLMs are trained on huge sets of data â€” hence the name "large." LLMs are built on machine learning: specifically, a type of neural network called a transformer model. - CLOUDFLARE</p>
